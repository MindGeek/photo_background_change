# Photo Background Converter

**verson: 1.0**

A small tool that can be used to convert a photo's background color from 'blue' to 'white'.

It's only a toy that I use to temporarily convert one of my own photo. It took my about 1.5 hour to dev and test it. There are many ugly hard-code in the code. Thus, do some change if you want to use it for your photo.
